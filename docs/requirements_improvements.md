# Requirements Generation Improvements

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive improvements made to the SAFE MBSE Requirements Generator to address key quality issues identified in the generated requirements. The improvements focus on achieving better balance, completeness, and traceability while maintaining ARCADIA methodology compliance.

## üéØ Issues Addressed

### 1. Priority Imbalance
**Problem**: Only 1.6% of requirements were marked as MUST, which is abnormally low for critical systems.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented context-aware priority analysis
- Target distribution: 30% MUST, 50% SHOULD, 20% COULD
- Enhanced priority analyzer with operational criticality indicators
- Automatic priority rebalancing based on confidence scores

### 2. NFR Overrepresentation  
**Problem**: 77% non-functional requirements is excessive and doesn't reflect real project needs.

**Solution**:
- Context-based NFR category selection
- Maximum 4 NFR categories per generation
- Relevance scoring based on document analysis
- Balanced generation (1-3 requirements per relevant category)

### 3. Truncated Descriptions
**Problem**: Many requirements had incomplete or too-short descriptions.

**Solution**:
- Minimum 25 words per requirement description
- Enhanced operational context integration
- Specific component and scenario references
- Automatic description enhancement for short requirements

### 4. Generic Verification Methods
**Problem**: "Review and testing" used uniformly for all requirements.

**Solution**:
- Phase-specific verification method selection
- Category-appropriate testing approaches
- Content-based verification method matching
- Comprehensive verification method database

### 5. Missing Traceability
**Problem**: Lack of explicit links to operational capabilities and scenarios.

**Solution**:
- Operational capability extraction and linking
- Scenario-based requirement traceability
- Stakeholder need mapping
- Phase-to-phase traceability enhancement

## üöÄ New Features

### Enhanced Requirements Generator

The `EnhancedRequirementsGenerator` class provides:

```python
from src.core.enhanced_requirements_generator import EnhancedRequirementsGenerator

# Initialize enhanced generator
enhanced_gen = EnhancedRequirementsGenerator(ollama_client)

# Generate balanced requirements
results = enhanced_gen.generate_balanced_requirements(
    context=document_context,
    phase="operational",
    proposal_text=proposal,
    requirement_types=["functional", "non_functional"]
)
```

### Requirements Improvement Service

The `RequirementsImprovementService` provides evaluation and comparison capabilities:

```python
from src.core.requirements_improvement_service import RequirementsImprovementService

# Initialize improvement service
improvement_service = RequirementsImprovementService(ollama_client)

# Generate improved requirements
improved_results = improvement_service.generate_improved_requirements(
    context, phase, proposal_text, requirement_types
)

# Compare approaches
comparison = improvement_service.compare_generation_approaches(
    context, phase, proposal_text, requirement_types
)
```

## üìä Quality Metrics

### Priority Distribution Scoring
- **Target**: 30% MUST, 50% SHOULD, 20% COULD
- **Measurement**: Deviation from target distribution
- **Threshold**: 85% balance score for acceptable quality

### Description Completeness
- **Criteria**: 
  - Minimum 20 words per description
  - Operational context indicators
  - Specific measurable criteria
- **Threshold**: 80% completeness score

### Verification Specificity
- **Measurement**: Percentage of non-generic verification methods
- **Generic methods**: "review and testing", "testing", "review", "validation"
- **Threshold**: 75% specificity score

### Traceability Coverage
- **Links tracked**:
  - Operational capability links
  - Operational scenario links
  - Stakeholder traceability
