- **System to Logical**: Functions ‚Üí Components, Requirements ‚Üí Allocation
- **Logical to Physical**: Components ‚Üí Implementation, Interfaces ‚Üí Physical
- **Requirements to Verification**: Requirements ‚Üí Test Methods

### 5. ARCADIA-Specific Vocabulary for Enhanced Embeddings

**Phase-Specific Vocabulary Sets:**
- **Operational**: 11 terms (mission, capability, operational activity, etc.)
- **System**: 11 terms (system function, functional chain, trade-off analysis, etc.)
- **Logical**: 10 terms (logical component, architecture driver, compromise, etc.)
- **Physical**: 10 terms (behavioral component, hosting component, reuse asset, etc.)
- **Building Strategy**: 10 terms (PBS, EPBS, integration contract, IVVQ, etc.)
- **Quality**: 10 terms (viewpoint, coherence, completeness, traceability, etc.)

Total: **62 specialized ARCADIA terms** for enhanced semantic understanding.

### 6. Verification and Consistency Framework

**Phase-Specific Verification Methods:**
- Stakeholder reviews and operational scenario validation
- Requirements traceability and functional analysis verification
