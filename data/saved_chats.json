This suggests that end-users, including consumers and small business owners, are likely key stakeholders.\n2. **Enterprises**: As the SAFE platform provides an umbrella of protection to all customers (end-users and/or enterprises) in its network, regardless of their technical knowledge or endpoint security state, it is reasonable to assume that enterprises with online presence and networks are also key stakeholders.\n3. **CERTs/CSIRTs**: The SAFE project aims to provide communication of technical and non-technical information about malware samples, incidents, attackers, and intelligence using standardized formats (e.g., STIX, TAXII, CybOX, ETSI CYBER), enabling knowledge sharing with CERTs/CSIRTs. This indicates that CERTs/CSIRTs (Computer Emergency Response Teams/Cyber Security Incident Response Teams) are likely key stakeholders.\n4. **Stakeholders and open-source communities**: The SAFE project aims to create synergies with relevant stakeholders and open-source communities, positioning the project at the intersection of technology communities and stakeholder groups. This suggests that various stakeholders and open-source communities may be involved in the project.\n\nWhile we cannot identify all key stakeholders from the provided context documents, these inferred stakeholders are likely to play important roles in the SAFE platform.\n\nPlease note that more detailed information about stakeholders might be available in other project documents or deliverables, such as the Dissemination and Communication plan mentioned in the context.",

This might involve creating standardized formats for sharing malware samples, incidents, attackers, and intelligence (e.g., STIX, TAXII, CybOX, ETSI CYBER).\n4. **Knowledge Sharing with CERTs/CSIRTs**: SAFE will enable knowledge sharing with Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) and Cyber Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) using standardized formats.\n\nIn summary, it appears that SAFE aims to:\n\n* Provide a secure foundation for critical social applications\n* Secure infrastructures and networks to protect customers\n* Facilitate threat sharing and knowledge exchange between organizations and CERTs/CSIRTs\n\nHowever, without further information on the SAFE system's architecture, design, or technical implementation, it is difficult to provide more specific details on how the system will work.",
