This allows for early analysis, simulation, verification, and validation of system designs, reducing the risk of errors and improving overall system performance.\n\nThe SAFE platform provides a set of tools and techniques to support the development of model-based systems engineering (MBSE) projects. It includes features such as:\n\n1. Modeling: Creating graphical models of systems using UML (Unified Modeling Language) and SysML (Systems Modeling Language).\n2. Simulation: Simulating system behavior using models, allowing for analysis and testing of different scenarios.\n3. Analysis: Performing quantitative and qualitative analyses on the system models to identify potential issues or areas for improvement.\n4. Verification and Validation: Verifying and validating that the system meets its requirements and behaves as expected.\n\nThe SAFE platform is widely used in industries such as aerospace, defense, automotive, and healthcare, where complex systems require rigorous design, testing, and validation processes.\n\nIn the context of the 'SAFE Project_test' documents, it is likely that this project aims to apply the SAFE methodology to develop a model-based system for testing and verification purposes.",

This study focuses on designing a smart ATM system to manage air traffic safely and efficiently, reduce delays, optimize runway utilization, and ensure compliance with environmental and safety regulations. The system must integrate advanced communication, navigation, and surveillance technologies to enable real-time decision-making and coordination. Actors Involved 1. Air Traffic Controllers (ATCs): Manage airspace and ensure safe distances between aircraft. 2. Pilots: Communicate with ATCs and comply with instructions for takeoff, landing, and taxiing. 3. Airport Ground Operations Staff: Oversee taxiway, runway operations, and ground vehicles. 4",
