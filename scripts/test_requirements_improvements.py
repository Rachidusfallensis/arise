    Project: Advanced Autonomous Vehicle Safety System

    The system must provide real-time collision avoidance capabilities for autonomous vehicles
    operating in urban environments. The system shall integrate multiple sensor inputs including
    LiDAR, cameras, and radar to detect obstacles and potential collision scenarios.

    Key operational capabilities required:
    - Real-time object detection and tracking
    - Path planning and collision avoidance
    - Emergency braking activation
    - Driver alert and notification system
    - System health monitoring and diagnostics

    Stakeholder needs:
    - Vehicle operators need reliable collision avoidance
    - Passengers require safety assurance
    - Regulatory authorities demand compliance with safety standards
    - Maintenance teams need diagnostic capabilities

    Performance requirements:
    - Response time less than 100 milliseconds
    - Detection range minimum 200 meters
    - System availability 99.9%
    - False positive rate less than 0.1%

    Security requirements:
    - Secure communication protocols
    - Protection against cyber attacks
    - Data encryption for sensitive information

    The system must be maintainable, scalable, and integrate with existing vehicle systems.
